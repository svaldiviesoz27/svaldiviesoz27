# System Protocol: Initiating Sequence...

### Systems Engineering Student at Universidad Nacional de Colombia

*"The unseen blade is the deadliest, but the unseen bug is the most persistent."* I am a developer in training, weaving shadows into logic and building an eternal architecture of code. My path lies at the intersection of **Front-end**, **Cybersecurity**, and **DevOps**, seeking to synchronize my skills with the demands of an ever-shifting reality.

### 🎸 Beyond the Code: Resonance & Drive

When I'm not optimizing my AT-Field or debugging the reality, you'll find me:

* **Musical Alchemy:** Multi-instrumentalist (Guitarist, Bassist, Pianist, and Vocalist). My code is often synchronized to the rhythm of:
    * *Linkin Park, BMTH, Bullet For My Valentine, Avenged Sevenfold, Asking Alexandria, Motionless In White, Hanabie., Arch Enemy, Poppy... and a heavy dose of **Eurobeat**.*
* **High-Speed Obsession:** A dedicated enthusiast of cars and motorcycles. I live for the adrenaline of the mountain passes and the "Most Wanted" spirit. Whether it's chasing the perfect drift or hitting the rev limiter on two wheels, I seek the limit of every machine. 🏍️ 🏎️
* **The World of Play:** Immersed in video games, exploring different realities and complex systems. 🎮
* **Physical Discipline:** A dedicated gymrat, tempering my body as I temper my code. 🏋️‍♂️
